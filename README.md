# ABOUT
This repository holds my complete implementation of the clox interpreter from the book Crafting Interpreters. All the tests (except the non-ascii strings one) are passing, and the language is feature complete. 

# NOTES
* I copied the tests and test runner from my clox (enrico-clox) repository and modified it one more time to handle running the tests for the Java version. The original version 
* I did not implement support for lists/arrays as I did with the C version.
